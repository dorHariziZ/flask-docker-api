# CRUD API Server with Docker

This repository contains a simple CRUD API server implemented using Flask (or an alternative framework). The server responds to basic API requests and logs the received data to the console. The application runs inside a Docker container.

## Project Goals
- Implement a basic CRUD API.
- Deploy and run the application inside a Docker container.
- Practice API development, Docker, and Git workflows.
- Gradually expand the project with more advanced features over time.

## Features
- **CRUD Endpoints:**
  - Create (`POST`)
  - Read (`GET`)
  - Update (`PUT`)
  - Delete (`DELETE`)
- **Logging:** Each endpoint currently prints a message to the console.
- **Containerized Environment:** The server runs inside a Docker container.

## Setup & Running
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (if running locally without Docker)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dorHariziZ/flask-docker-api.git

```

## Future Enhancements
This project will evolve over time with new features such as:
- Database integration
- Authentication & Authorization
- Improved logging & monitoring
- Deployment to cloud services
