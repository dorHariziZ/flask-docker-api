# Crypto API Apprenticeship Project  

This repository is an ongoing apprenticeship project where I meet with **Yuval Tamir** ([GitHub Profile](https://github.com/yuvalta)) once a week to develop and improve the project. The goal is to create an apprenticeship and training path for juniors in the company, focusing on hands-on development, best practices, and deployment strategies.  

## **Project Overview**  

The project is a Flask-based REST API server that provides cryptocurrency market data and CRUD functionality. It is designed to run inside a Docker container to ensure consistency across different environments.  

The development is structured into two phases:  

### **Task 1 - `server_v1`**  

The first phase focuses on building a basic CRUD API server. The API allows users to create, read, update, and delete items, while ensuring scalability and maintainability through containerization with Docker.  

#### **Key Features:**  
- A Flask-based API server with basic CRUD operations  
- Running the server inside a Docker container  
- Logging received data for tracking requests  
- Initial deployment setup  

---

### **Task 2 - `server_v2`**  

The second phase extends the functionality by integrating cryptocurrency price data retrieval and improving the development workflow with Git best practices.  

#### **Key Features:**  
- A server that fetches cryptocurrency prices from an external API  
- Installation of required dependencies using `requirements.txt` within Docker  
- Addition of a `.gitignore` file for better repository management  
- Implementation of Git commands for better version control, including:  
  - `git rebase`  
  - `git amend` on `origin`  
  - `git reset`  
  - `git revert`  

This project will continue to evolve as new features and improvements are introduced through weekly meetings. The goal is to refine development skills, enhance API performance, and optimize deployment strategies.
